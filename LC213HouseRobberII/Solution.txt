Now the houses are arranged in a circle, i.e., the last house will be affected by the state of the first house

We know how to solve the problem if the states of last house and first house are independent (House Robber)

Is it possible to divide this problem into sub-problems that satisfy the above requirement?

Example: n = 5

0 X X X X
1 0 X X 0

Maximum among the answers of the 2 sub-problems are the final answer
