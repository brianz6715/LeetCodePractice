1) Merge two sorted lists
    1 3 5 6 7 8
    2 3 4 9 11
    - Take first element of the 2 lists, then compare
    - Put "1" in new list, take second element in first list

2) Merge K sorted lists
    - Adopt and adapt solution in 1) by taking first element of all lists
        - Priority Queue
        - Heap
            - Insertion: O(logn)
            - Removal:   O(logn)
            - Construction: O(n)
    - Adopt solution in 1), use divide and conquer to merge the lists 2 by 2
