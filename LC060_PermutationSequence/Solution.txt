Solution 1: direct calculation (deterministic no recursion)
    For example, if n = 4 -> numbers for permutation are "1234"
    "1XXX" group has (n-1)! permutations
    "2XXX" group also has (n-1)! permutations
    ...
    As a result, if (i-1)*(n-1)! < k <= i*(n-1)!, first number must be "i"

    Can second number be determined by the same rule?
    Modification is needed.
    i should be "index" instead of "number"
    For example: 
    n = 4, k = 8
    Round 1,
    3! < k <= 2 * 3! -> first number should be "1234"[2]
    Round 2, 
    residual count = 2, candidate numbers = "134"
    0 < residual <= 2!, second number should be "134"[1]
    Round 3,
    residual count = 2, candidate numbers = "34"
    1! < residual <= 2 * 1!, third number should be "34"[2]
    -------->>>> "2143"
    

Solution 2: back tracking
   Use back tracking to go through all possible answers with a counter
   if # of counter == k -> return answer
