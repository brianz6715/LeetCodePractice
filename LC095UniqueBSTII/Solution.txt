Solution 1: use DFS (depth first search), not sure if it's DP or not
    use n = 2 as example:
     1                2
    /  \             /  \
  [ ]   2           1   [ ]
      /  \         /  \
    [ ]  [ ]     [ ]  [ ]



Solution 2: DP, use answer of n = k to build answer of n = k+1
    If n = 2, the answer is:
     1                2
    /  \             /  \
  [ ]  2           1   [ ]
      /  \         /  \
    [ ]  [ ]     [ ]  [ ]

    How to build answer of n = 3?
    a) add 3 as root
    b) add 3 not as root
        one possibility per layer!
       3            1              1
      /              \              \
     1                3              2
    /  \             /  \             \
  [ ]   2           2   [ ]            3
